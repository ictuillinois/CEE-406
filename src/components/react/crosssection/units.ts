/* ============================================================
   Cross-Section Studio — SI and English

   Every length in the studio's state is stored in MILLIMETERS, always, and
   the renderer never sees anything else. The unit switch is a presentation
   layer over that, plus the one thing it would be dishonest to leave out: it
   re-rounds the numbers.

   A pavement thickness is a DESIGNATION, not a measurement. FAA P-401 is
   specified as "75 mm (3 in.)" and those are the same lift; nobody builds
   2.953 in. So switching to English does not relabel a 75-mm layer as
   2.95 in, it makes it a 3-in layer, and switching back makes it a 75-mm
   layer again. The table is the soft conversion the specifications
   themselves print, 25 mm to the inch:

       40  1.5     125  5      300  12
       50  2       150  6      350  14
       75  3       200  8      400  16
       100 4       250  10     500  20

   Two constants doing two different jobs, and neither can stand in for the
   other:

     NOMINAL_MM_PER_IN (25)  rounds a designation, and only the unit switch
                             touches it.
     MM_PER_IN (25.4)        draws one. What is stored for a 3-in layer is
                             3 x 25.4, so a section a student labels 3 in is
                             exactly 3 in tall in the figure and in the
                             exported PNG.

   This module has no import of any kind: no THREE, no React, no state. The
   round trips it promises are asserted in units.test.mjs against every
   thickness the studio actually ships, which is the only way to know the two
   constants have not been crossed.
